    <p class="para common">Spain is a country that counts with one of the richest
       cuisines in the world. Its different cultures and 
       influences over the ages, have defined a variety of 
       dishes that are well known within the whole Spanish
       territory, some of them even worldwide.</p> 

    <p class="para">To celebrate Spanish gastronomy, I have selected some
       of the most well-known traditional dishes, that every 
       Spanish food enthusiast should know how to cook. <strong><em>My 
       hope is that you can do such delicious meals too!!</em></strong></p>
