    <h2>Everyone's favourite <em>tapa</em></h2>
    <p>Croquettes are probably a universally liked <em>tapa</em> which is tradition in Spain. They can come in many flavours, but I have chosen one of the most typical and tasty, the jam-filled croquette.</p>
    <h3><ins>Ingredients (for 3 people)</ins></h3>
        <h4>For the croquettes dough:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>100g of cured jam</li>
            <li>Half an onion</li>
            <li>A clove of garlic</li>
            <li>50g of flour</li>
            <li>50g of butter (or 50ml of extra virgin olive oil)</li>
            <li>0.5l of milk</li>
            <li>Parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the coat and frying:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>2 beat eggs</li>
            <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>
    <h3><ins>Preparation</ins></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the butter into dices and add it to a pot for to slowly melt. Cut the onion and the garlic small and add them to the pot with the butter. Cook the mix for 5 to 6 minutes, and add the jam in small cuts. Stir-fry the mix.</li>
        <li>Pour the flour into the pot and stir fry again. When the flour has some color, start adding milk little by little while constantly stiring the mix. Cook the mix (<em>bechamel</em>) for about 20 minutes with a medium heat while constantly stiring. Add some small-cut parsley.</li>
        <li>Pour the croquettes mass onto a platter and cover it with some fil paper so it doesn't dry. Let it cool.</li>
        <li>When the mass has cooled, cut it and mold the croquettes.</li>
        <li>Coat the croquettes in flour firstly, the beat egg afterwards, and fry them in hot olive oil.</li>
        <li>When the croquettes are fried, take them out of the oil and dry them from the excess of oil by leaving them on a kitchen paper covered dish.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy them while still hot :P.</li>
