    <p>Paella is probably Spain's most international dish, and there are lots of yummy versions of it. Below I present you the original version of spanish people favourite rice dish, coming straight out of Valencia.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>250g of round grain rice</li>
        <li>250g of chicken</li>
        <li>250g of rabbit</li>

    </ul>
    <h3><ins>Preparation</ins></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the rabbit and chicken into pieces, salt them and stir-fry them on the pan with olive oil. When it has some color, put all the meat on the pan's side, leaving its center empty-spaced.</li>
        <li>Grate the tomatoes and throw them into the pan's center. Cut the green beans and add them too. Add also the water and saffron, and cook everything with a medium heat for 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Check the broth is tasty enough and correct the salt if needed. Add the rice and extend it along the pan. Cook with a hard heat for 6 to 8 minutes, and afterwards change to a soft-heat for 10 to 13 minutes. Before the last 5 minutes, add the rosemary branch into the pan.</li>
        <li>When the cooking time ends, take the pan out of the heat and leave it still for 5 to 8 minutes. After that, take the rosemary branch out.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy a delicious meal :P.</li>
