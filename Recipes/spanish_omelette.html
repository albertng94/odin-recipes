    <p class="para font bold">The Spanish omelette is a tasty dish made with eggs, potatoes and sometimes onions.</p>
    <h3 class="red"><ins>Ingredients (for 2 people)</ins></h3>
    <ul class="para font">
        <li>375g of potatoes</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 little-sized onion</li>
        <li>Half green pepper</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="red"><ins>Preparation</ins></h3>
    <ol class="para font left">
        <li>Peel and cut the potatoes into uneven or cube-sized pieces. Salt them and put them to fry on the frying pan using abundant olive oil.</li>
        <li>Peel and cut the onions into little pieces and throw them to fry with the potatoes. Do the same with the pepper. Mix everything and stir frequently until everything is well fried.</li>
        <li>Withdraw the mix from the heat and dry it from the olive oil.</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs and add them to the rest of the ingredients. Mix everything well.</li>
        <li>Put a little more olive oil into a frying pan and add the mixed ingredients. Cook it firstly at medium heat and afterwards at soft heat, until the egg curdles from below. Then, turn the omelette around and repeat the process until both sides are cooked (an easy tip to turn around the omelette without making a mess consists on putting a dish over frying pan and doing a fast flip while holding it together).</li>
        <li>Serve the dish while hot and enjoy :P.</li>
    </ol>
