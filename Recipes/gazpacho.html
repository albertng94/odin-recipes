    <h2>A refreshing tomato-based soup</h2>
    <p>Gazpacho is probably the spanish favourite cold soup. It is original from Andalucia and is known as a healthy ideal opener for those hot summer meals. Let's see how it's done!</p>
    <h3><ins>Ingredients</ins></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>0.5 kilos of ripe tomatoes</li>
        <li>Half a green pepper</li>
        <li>Half a cucumber</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>1dl of olive oil</li>
        <li>4 spoons of wine vinegar</li>
        <li>A big slice of white bread</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><ins>Preparation</ins></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dip the tomatoes in boiling water to easily peel them. Introduce them into the mixer's vase alongside the cuts of pepper, peeled cucumber, and the garlic. Add also the bread, previously soaked in water.</li>
        <li>Grind the mix for a few seconds. Salt the mix and add the vinegar and olive oil. Correct according to your taste.</li>
        <li>Filter the soup using a strainer and put it inside the fridge. Let it cool for an hour.</li>
        <li>If you wish, you can eat the Gazpacho alone, but in Spain is typical to present it adding a small-cut of vegetables, stir-fried small-cuts of jam, or grated boiled egg into the soup. Whatever you do, serve it cold!</li>
        <li>Enjoy your refreshing healthy meal</li>
    </ol>
